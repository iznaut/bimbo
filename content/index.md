i wanted a blog. so i tried some Static Site Generator tools and they all seemed more complicated than i needed

i liked the vibe of Zonelets, but missed some of the nice stuff you get with an SSG

what's a girl to do when she's too smart for the simple tool but too dumb for the advanced tools?

she makes her own dumb tool.
