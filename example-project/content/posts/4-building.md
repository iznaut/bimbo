would love to implement some proper support for this at some point (e.g. run a command to upload your site) but for now it's a manual process.

to put it simply: everything in your `/public` folder should be uploaded to your webhost!

there are plenty of options for hosting, but it seems like [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) is the one i hear about most commonly. personally, i've been trying out [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/), which is nice so far.
