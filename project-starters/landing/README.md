this README file exists to give you a bit more context for this project starter - it's not required by bimbo and you can feel free to delete it after reading.

the "landing" starter is a modified version of https://github.com/vitor-antoni/linktree-template. it is meant to emulate Linktree and other similar services which only provide a single page with a simple list of links.
