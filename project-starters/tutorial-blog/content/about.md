bimbo is a "static site generator" - a tool that can help you build a website without having to do a lot of busy work. it was made by [izzy kestrel](https://iznaut.com/) for her personal use, but maybe it could be of value to others as well.

the default look and feel of this blog was directly ripped from [Marina Ayano Kittaka](https://bsky.app/profile/even-kei.bsky.social)'s [Zonelets](https://zonelets.net/). you could likely drop in any Zonelets themes with bimbo and they should Just Work.

shoutouts also to [Kate Bagenzo](https://katebagenzo.neocities.org/)'s [Strawberry Starter](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/) which might be considered a different approach to the same problem that bimbo is trying to solve (but probably a smarter one, since it uses an established SSG as a base)
